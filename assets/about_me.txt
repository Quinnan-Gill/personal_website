Hi, it seems you have stumbled upon my website. While you are here let me tell you
a little about me. I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of
Pittsburgh. I am incredibly interested in robotics and cybersecurity. However both
interests originate back from my love for programming. In fact this website was
entirely made by me with JavaScript and jQuery. When I am not programming I
enjoy watching movies.
